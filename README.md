# time-mate-android
TimeMateX is my hands-on exploration of Android development, where I build a timestamp conversion tool similar to the web tools I frequently use, such as epochconverter.com. This app converts Unix timestamps to human-readable dates and vice versa. The goal is to learn and apply Android fundamentals while creating a practical tool.
